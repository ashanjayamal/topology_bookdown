# Topological Spaces.

```{definition}
A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ such that

(T1) $\phi$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$;

(T2) Any union of subsets in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$;

(T3) The finite intersection of subsets in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

```
This is the first chapter
