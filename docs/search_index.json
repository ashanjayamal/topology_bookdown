A set \\(X\\) with a topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called a topological space. Denoted by \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\). An element of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called an open set. Example 1.1 Let \\(X\\) be a three-element set, \\(X = \\{a, b, c\\}\\) and \\(\\tau=\\{X, \\emptyset,\\{a, b\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{b, c\\}\\}\\). We can check T1,T2 and T3 conditions. Example 1.2 Let \\(X\\) be a three-element set, \\(X = \\{a, b, c\\}\\) as pervoius. There are many possible topologies on \\(X\\), some of which are indicated schematically in figure 1.1. Furthur, we can see that even a three-element set has many different topologies. Figure 1.1: \\(~\\) Remark. Not every collection of subsets of \\(X\\) is a topology on \\(X\\). Observe that Neither of the collections indicated in figure 1.2 is a topology. First letâ€™s consider the left hand coner of figure 1.2. \\(\\{a\\}\\) and \\(\\{b\\}\\) in the collection, but \\(\\{a\\}\\cup \\{b\\}\\) is not in the collection. Now consider the right hand coner figure. \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) and \\(\\{b,c\\}\\) in collection, but \\(\\{a,b\\}\\cap\\{b,c\\}=\\{b\\}\\) is not in the collection. Figure 1.2: \\(~\\) Example 1.3 If \\(X\\) is any set, the collection of all subsets of \\(X\\) (Power set) is a topology on \\(X\\). This trivail statified T1 T2 and T3 conditions. Furthur,This is called the discrete topology. Example 1.4 The collection consisting of \\(X\\) and \\(\\emptyset\\) only is also a topologyon \\(X\\). we shall call it the indiscrete topology, or the trivial topology.
