Basically it is given by declaring which subsets are “open” sets. Thus the axioms are the abstraction of the properties that open sets have. 1.1 Topological Spaces Definition 1.1 A topology on a set \\(X\\) is a collection \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) of subsets of \\(X\\) such that (T1) \\(\\phi\\) and \\(X\\) are in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\); (T2) Any union of subsets in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\); (T3) The finite intersection of subsets in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). A set \\(X\\) with a topology \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called a topological space. Denoted by \\((X,\\mathcal{T})\\). An element of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is called an open set. Example 1.1 Let \\(X\\) be a three-element set, \\(X = \\{a, b, c\\}\\) and \\(\\tau=\\{X, \\emptyset,\\{a, b\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{b, c\\}\\}\\). We can check T1,T2 and T3 conditions. Example 1.2 Let \\(X\\) be a three-element set, \\(X = \\{a, b, c\\}\\) as pervoius. There are many possible topologies on \\(X\\), some of which are indicated schematically in figure 1.1. Furthur, we can see that even a three-element set has many different topologies. Figure 1.1: \\(~\\) Remark. Not every collection of subsets of \\(X\\) is a topology on \\(X\\). Observe that Neither of the collections indicated in figure 1.2 is a topology. First let’s consider the left hand coner of figure 1.2. \\(\\{a\\}\\) and \\(\\{b\\}\\) in the collection, but \\(\\{a\\}\\cup \\{b\\}\\) is not in the collection. Now consider the right hand coner figure. \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) and \\(\\{b,c\\}\\) in collection, but \\(\\{a,b\\}\\cap\\{b,c\\}=\\{b\\}\\) is not in the collection. Figure 1.2: \\(~\\) Example 1.3 If \\(X\\) is any set, the collection of all subsets of \\(X\\) (Power set) is a topology on \\(X\\). This trivail statified T1 T2 and T3 conditions. Furthur,This is called the discrete topology. Example 1.4 The collection consisting of \\(X\\) and \\(\\emptyset\\) only is also a topologyon \\(X\\). we shall call it the indiscrete topology, or the trivial topology. Example 1.5 Let \\(X\\) be a set and let \\(\\tau_f\\) be the collection of all subsets U of X such that \\(X\\setminus U\\) either is finite or is all of \\(X\\). In oter words, \\[\\tau_f:=\\left\\{U\\subseteq X : \\text{Either is finite or is all of } X\\right\\}\\] Let’s check is \\(\\tau_f\\) a topology. First obseve that both \\(X\\) and \\(\\emptyset\\) are in \\(\\tau_f\\) , because \\(X\\setminus X\\) is finite and $X$ is all of \\(X\\).So \\(\\tau_f\\) statified the T1 condition. Now let’s check the T2 condition. Let \\(\\{U_{\\alpha}:\\alpha\\in I, I \\text{is index set}\\}\\).Now we need to show that \\(\\cup{\\alpha\\in I} U_\\alpha\\in \\tau_f\\). So consider, \\[X\\setminus \\cup_{\\alpha\\in I} U_\\alpha =\\cap_{\\alpha\\in I} (X\\setminus U_\\alpha).\\] Now obsevere that {I} (XU) is finite, because each set \\((X\\setminus U_\\alpha)\\) is finite and arbitary intersection of finite sets is finite. So, \\(\\tau_f\\) stattified the T2 condition also. Finaly check the last condition, T3 condition. Let \\(U_1,...,U_n\\) are nonempty elements of \\(\\tau_f\\) , to show that \\(\\Cup_i U_i \\in \\tau_f\\) , we compute \\[X\\setminus \\cap_{i=1}^n U_i = \\cup_{i=1}^n(X \\setminus U_i).\\] Note that the set \\(\\cup_{i=1}^n(X \\setminus U_i)\\) is a finite union of finite sets and, therefore, finite. So it statisfiy the T3 condition also. Thefore \\(\\tau_f\\) is a topology. Furthur \\(\\tau_f\\) is called the finite complement topology. Example 1.6 Let \\(X\\) be a set. Define \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) to be the collection of all subsets \\(U\\) of \\(X\\) such that \\(X\\setminus U\\) either is finite or is all of \\(X\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) defines a topology on \\(X\\), called finite complement topology of \\(X\\). 1.2 Basis of a Topology Once we define a structure on a set, often we try to understand what the minimum data you need to specify the structure. In many cases, this minimum data is called a basis and we say that the basis generate the structure. The notion of a basis of the structure will help us to describe examples more systematically. Definition 1.2 Let \\(X\\) be a set. A basis of a topology on \\(X\\) is a collection \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of subsets in \\(X\\) such that (B1) For every \\(x \\in X\\), there exist an element \\(B\\) in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) such that \\(x \\in B\\). (B2) If \\(x \\in B_{1} \\cap B_{2}\\) where \\(B_{1}, B_{2}\\) are in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), then there is \\(B_{3}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) such that \\(x \\in B_{3} \\subseteq B_{1} \\cap B_{2}\\). Lemma 1.1 (Generating of a topology) Let \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) be a basis of a topology on X. Define \\(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathcal{B}}\\) to be the collection of subsets \\(U \\subset X\\) satisfting (G1) For every \\(x \\in U\\), there is \\(B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\) such that \\(x \\in B \\subset U\\). Then \\(\\tau_{\\mathcal{B}}\\) defines a topology on \\(X\\). Here we assume that \\(\\varnothing\\) trivially satisfies the condition, so that \\(\\varnothing \\in \\tau_{\\mathcal{B}}\\). Proof. We need to check the three axioms: "],["chapter-2-name.html", "Chapter 2 Chapter 2 name", " Chapter 2 Chapter 2 name "],["chapter-03-name.html", "Chapter 3 Chapter 03 name", " Chapter 3 Chapter 03 name Up to there is none.
